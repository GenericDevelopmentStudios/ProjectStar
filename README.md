TODO:
1. Game Design Document
  -Latex Confirmed
2. GitHub and Unreal Familiarization

Basically upload the GDD to Git and get to know the functionality of Git and Unreal.

Xeno: Main focus in Git and Tex
Average: Main focus in Unreal and Hex construction

Suggestions(Xeno):
Planetary Terrain have inherent effects on non-combat stats. Arctic slows down movement speed AND adds attrition that the Army Stack should overcome by better equipment. Same could apply for toxic\polluted hexagons. A unit in a desert\arctic planet might consume more supply instead of simply dying or what not.
